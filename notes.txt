1. download chip data:
    download_chip_data.sh

2. check if openable and dowload missing:
    check_tracks.py
    redownload_error_chip_data.sh

3. Merge peaks from same tf and compute jaccard as tf pair similarity:
    merge_tf_bigbeds.sh
    jaccard_index_tf_peaks.sh

4. download complex from complex portal save as interaction matrix
    download_complex_data.sh
    get_complex_proteins.py

5. Plot complex matrix and jaccard index
    plot_tf_complex_vs_peaks_jaccard.py

6. Clustering TFs based on Jaccard (ongoing)
    clustering_tf_on_jaccard.py

7. Get one one track per tf, intersect with ATAC-seq and promoter.
    combine_peaks_intersect_with_tracks.py
